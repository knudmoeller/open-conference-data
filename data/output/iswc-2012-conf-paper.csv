The graph enhances Google search in three main ways: by disambiguation of search queries, by search log-based summarization of key facts, and by explorative search suggestions. With this paper, we suggest a fourth way of enhancing Web search: through the addition of realtime coverage of what people say about real-world entities on social networks. We report on a browser extension that seamlessly adds relevant microposts from the social networking sites Google+, Facebook, and Twitter in form of a panel to Knowledge Graph entities. In a true Linked Data fashion, we interlink detected concepts in microposts with Freebase entities, and evaluate our approach for both relevancy and usefulness.

This approach enables the mapping algorithm to exploit query semantics to correctly choose among ontology mappings that are indistinguishable when only the ontologies are considered. Also, the mapping associates paths with paths, instead of entities with entities. This approach simplifies query reformulation.

Unlike the traditional scientific naming system, which is based on evolutionary relationships, it emphasizes the observable features of organisms. By independently naming the descriptions composed of sets of observational features, as well as maintaining connections to scientific names, it preserves the observational data used to identify organisms. The system is designed to support a peer-review mechanism for creating new names, and uses a controlled vocabulary encoded in the Web Ontology Language to represent the observational features. A prototype of the system is currently under development in collaboration with the Mushroom Observer website. It allows users to propose new names and descriptions, provide feedback on those proposals, and ultimately have them formally approved. This effort aims at offering the mycology community a knowledge base of fungal observational features and a tool for identifying fungal observations. ",,,0,,0,Nathan Wilson;Deborah L.

It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings: if O1 and O2 are two ontologies used to classify a common set X , then mappings between O1 and O2 are interpreted to encode how elements of X classified in the concepts of O1 are re-classified in the concepts of O2, and weights are interpreted to measure how precise and complete re-classifications are. This semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching. It is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings.

In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case. For making the application of our method feasible also to large KBs we present a signature-based mapping algorithm with n logn complexity.

However, the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First, we divide the users' transactions into epochs i.e. time periods, and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus, it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second, we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch. This well captures the interests of users in each epoch even if there are few transactions. It suits the situations in which the items transacted by users dynamically change over time; the semantics behind classes do not change so often while individual items often appear and disappear. Fortunately, many taxonomies are now available on the web because of the spread of the Linked Open Data vision. We can now use those to understand dynamic user interests semantically. We evaluate our method using a dataset, a music listening history, extracted from users' tweets and one containing a restaurant visit history gathered from a gourmet guide site.

First, it is often quite difficult to even determine which concepts have had their meaning altered by a change. Second, once a concept change is pinpointed, the problem of distinguishing whether the concept is directly or indirectly affected by a change has yet to be tackled. To address the first issue, various principled notions of ``semantic diff'' (based on deductive inseparability) have been proposed in the literature and shown to be computationally practical for the expressively restricted case of ELHr-terminologies. However, problems arise even for such limited logics as ALC: First, computation gets more difficult, becoming undecidable for logics such as SROIQ which underly the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the presence of negation and disjunction make the standard semantic difference too sensitive to change: essentially, any logically effectual change always affects all terms in the ontology. In order to tackle these issues, we formulate the central notion of finding the minimal change set based on model inseparability, and present a method to differentiate changes which are specific to (thus directly affect) particular concept names. Subsequently we devise a series of computable approximations, and compare the variously approximated change sets over a series of versions of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).",,,0,,0,Bijan Parsia;Ulrike Sattler;Rafael S.

A static and a dynamic algorithm are presented which use these costs to find optimal or near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query. For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster.

This extended concept language enables us to find more complete definitions and to even align sources that have rudimentary ontologies, such as those that are simple renderings of relational databases.

We explore how to express the notion of a domain in terms usable for an ontology matching tool, and we examine various methods to decide what constitutes the domain of a given dataset. We show how we can use this in a matching tool, and study the effect of domain knowledge on the quality of the alignment. We perform evaluations for two scenarios: Last.fm artists and UMLS medical terms. To quantify the added value of domain knowledge, we compare our domain-aware matching approach to a standard approach based on a manually created reference alignment. The results indicate that the proposed domain-aware approach indeed outperforms the standard approach, with a large effect on ambiguous concepts but a much smaller effect on unambiguous concepts.",,,0,,0,Laura Hollink;Kristian Slabbekoorn;Geert-Jan Houben,3,,0

The SPARQL-RANK algebra is an extended SPARQL algebra that treats order as a first class citizen, enabling efficient split-and-interleave processing schemes that can be adopted to improve the performance of top-k SPARQL queries. In this paper we propose an incremental execution model for SPARQL-RANK queries, we compare the performance of alternative physical operators, and we propose a rank-aware join algorithm optimized for native RDF stores.

QuID is a reasoner for OWL 2 QL that is based on the system Quonto and is able to deal with inconsistent ontologies. The central aspect of QuID is that it implements two different, orthogonal strategies for dealing with inconsistency: ABox repairing techniques, based on data manipulation, and consistent query answering techniques, based on query rewriting. Moreover, by exploiting the ability of Quonto to delegate the management of the ABox to a relational database system (DBMS), such techniques are potentially able to handle very large inconsistent ABoxes. For the above reasons, QuID allows for experimentally comparing the above two different strategies for inconsistency handling in the context of OWL 2 QL. We thus report on the experimental evaluation that we have conducted using QuID. Our results clearly point out that inconsistency-tolerance in OWL 2 QL ontologies is feasible in practical cases.

This class of solutions promises both to facilitate the integration of research data with other relevant sources of information and also to support more intelligent forms of querying and exploration. However, an issue which has only been partially addressed is that of generating and characterizing semantically the relations that exist between research areas. This problem has been traditionally addressed by manually creating taxonomies, such as the ACM classification of research topics. However, this manual approach is inadequate for a number of reasons: these taxonomies are very coarse-grained and they do not cater for the finegrained research topics, which define the level at which typically researchers (and even more so, PhD students) operate. Moreover, they evolve slowly, and therefore they tend not to cover the most recent research trends. In addition, as we move towards a semantic characterization of these relations, there is arguably a need for a more sophisticated characterization than a homogeneous taxonomy, to reflect the different ways in which research areas can be related. In this paper we propose Klink, a new approach to i) automatically generating relations between research areas and ii) populating a bibliographic ontology, which combines both machine learning methods and external knowledge, which is drawn from a number of resources, including Google Scholar and Wikipedia. We have tested a number of alternative algorithms and our evaluation shows that a method relying on both external knowledge and the ability to detect temporal relations between research areas performs best with respect to a manually constructed standard.",,,0,,0,Enrico Motta;Francesco Osborne,2,,0

The prime inference problem is computing answer probabilities, and it can be implemented using standard probabilistic database systems. We establish a PTime vs. #P dichotomy for the data complexity of this problem by lifting a corresponding result from probabilistic databases. We also demonstrate that query rewriting (backwards chaining) is an important tool for our framework, show that non-existence of a rewriting into first-order logic implies #P-hardness, and briefly discuss approximation of answer probabilities.",,,0,,0,Carsten Lutz;Jean Christoph Jung,2,,0

Even very experienced modellers with a sophisticated grasp of reasoning algorithms do not have a good mental model of reasoner performance behaviour. Seemingly innocuous changes to an OWL ontology can degrade classification time from instantaneous to too long to wait for. Similarly, switching reasoners (e.g., to take advantage of specific features) can result in wildly different classification times. In this paper we investigate performance variability phenomena in OWL ontologies, and present methods to identify subsets of an ontology which are performance-degrading for a given reasoner. When such (ideally small) subsets are removed from an ontology, and the remainder is much easier for the given reasoner to reason over, we designate them âhot spotsâ?. The identification of these hot spots allows users to isolate difficult portions of the ontology in a principled and systematic way. Moreover, we devise and compare various methods for approximate reasoning and knowledge compilation based on hot spots. We verify our techniques with a select set of varyingly difficult ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal, and were able to, firstly, successfully identify performance hot spots against the major freely available DL reasoners, and, secondly, significantly improve classification time using approximate reasoning based on hot spots.",,,0,,0,Bijan Parsia;Ulrike Sattler;Rafael S.

When asking conjunctive queries on NLP graphs, the Recall of the query is expected to be roughly the product of the Recall of the relations in each conjunct. Since Recall is typically less than one, conjunctive query Recall on NLP graphs degrades geometrically with the number of conjuncts. We present an approach to address this Recall problem by hypothesizing links in the graph that would improve query Recall, and then attempting to find more evidence to support them.

With safety, we mean that the system guides the end-user from a set of common mild medical signs to adapted molecules and drug products, but also highlights the risks, e.g. drug interactions, adverse events, of self prescribing a drug in a given situation. The efficiency argument corresponds to providing a rating, based on a tolerance/efficiency ratio designed by a team of health care professionals, to some identified self-medication molecules.

Although, existing interaction paradigms in semantic search hide the complexity behind an easy-to-use interface, they have not managed to cover common search needs. In this paper, we present X-ENS (eXplore ENtities in Search), a web search application that enhances the classical, keyword-based, web searching with semantic information, as a means to combine the pros of both Semantic Web standards and common Web Searching. X-ENS identifies entities of interest in the snippets of the top search results which can be further exploited in a faceted search-like interaction scheme, and thereby can help the user to limit the - often very large - search space to those hits that contain a particular piece of information. Moreover, X-ENS permits the exploration of the identified entities by exploiting semantic repositories.",,,0,,0,Pavlos Fafalios;Yannis Tzitzikas,2,,0

The current version of BKR provides a unified provenance representation for 12 million semantic predications (triples with a predicate connecting a subject and an object) derived from 87 vocabulary families in the UMLS and 14 million predications extracted from 21 million PubMed abstracts. To engage the domain experts in studying and exploring such a comprehensive knowledge base, we developed the iExplore to: 1) visualize and navigate all the possible semantic predications related to concepts of interest, and 2) search for interesting links between concepts. We also provide an authorization mechanism for SPARQL queries generated by the iExplore to support licensed access to UMLS. We demonstrate the use of iExplore in two scenarios: 1) current research in biomedicine, and 2) re-exploration of two previously known literature-based discoveries. iExplore is available at http://knoesis.wright.edu/iExplore.",,,0,,0,Satya Sahoo;Hima Yalamanchili;Bastien Rance;Jagannathan Srinivasan;Ramakanth Kavuluru;Vinh Nguyen;Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan;Amit Sheth;Todd Minning;Thomas Rindflesch;Olivier Bodenreider,11,,0

The platform uses first-order, description logic reasoning to examine input data types, output data types, and service descriptions to discover services. At each step the user is presented with only those services which operate on the data at that stage in a pipeline. The platform coordinates third-party service invocations, including transaction-time reasoning at third-party web sites. It includes a Just-In-Time ontology editor to allow anyone to host ontologies on our servers; ontologies may also be hosted anywhere on the web. The platform enables TreeGenes, a large biological information resource, to offer single-click marshalling of data and service discovery to semantic pipelines engaging enterprise-class resources at the University of Arizona and high performance computing (HPC) resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The HPC results are sent to other distributed semantic web services, such as phylogenetic tree visualization and University of California CartograTree geographical mapping resource.",,,0,,0,John Yu;Jill Wegrzyn;Pavel Klinov;Hans Vasquez-Gross;Damian Gessler;Yan Kang;Evren Sirin;Blazej Bulka,8,,0
